    <h1>HGRU AR Quiz App Evaluation</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>The quiz app includes all requested features with many addition features.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Required Functionality</h2>
        <p>The app includes the following required features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Select start on the opening screen:</strong> The app presents the user with a start screen that allows the user to click start. There is a watermark that says <b>By Max</b> that is possition perfectly so it can be replaced with a copyright subtext or footer.</li>
            <li><strong>Select a topic that will open at question 1:</strong> After scanning an AR marker or manually starting the quiz, the quiz starts, instead of starting on question one however, the quiz is started on a random question, this adds diverstity and makes the quiz feel different when it's replayed.</li>
            <li><strong>Use interaction/layers to choose an answer and be informed whether it is right or wrong:</strong> Answer boxes appear in a random order and will be different every time you play the quiz. The quiz questions can be added and modifed in quiz.json file, this allows for expandability. More than 3 questions can also be added to make the quiz more immersive.</li>
            <li><strong>Select a different answer if the wrong answer has been chosen :</strong> This feature is not directly usable while combining the required scoring system as changing an answer would mean the user would always get 100% and not learn anything. So to meet this requirment, after a quiz the user is presented the option to replay the quiz, this allows them to <b>"select a different answer if the wrong answer has been chosen"</b> without compramising the scoring system and also ensure they actually know it as replaying the quiz re-orders the questions and anwsers.</li>
            <li><strong>Use interaction/layers to move to the next question once the correct answer has been chosen:</strong> The app will automatically move you onto the next question 3 seconds after getting a question incorrect, the interaction for this is answering a question, this keeps a fast paced action pack feel the app, it increase retention as you are not requried to click to continue/./</li>
            <li><strong>Use interaction/layers to move back to the opening screen after the third question:</strong> After the final question which - will be the <b>"third question"</b> for the provided assets in the quiz.json file - the app returns to a new screen asking the user if they wish to replay the quiz (accomidating for other requirements) with another option asking if they would like to return to the scan page.</li>
        </ul>
